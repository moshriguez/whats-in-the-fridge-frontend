# What's in the Fridge? - Frontend

## Introduction
Let's say you are cooking a new recipe and it calls for an ingredient that you aren't familiar with cooking. The new recipe did not use up that new ingredient and now it will likely just sit in your fridge until it goes bad and you have to throw it away. If only there were an app that could give you ideas on how to use that ingredient again. This is the problem our app seeks to solve.

Logged in users can add ingredients to their fridge and then search for recipes with that ingredient.
